DESCRIPTION
--------------
	file-voodoo is a statistical tool for file-type identification.
	The idea is to use "Cosine similarity" or "tf*idf" for both n-grams 
	and offseted n-grams.
	
OPEN QUESTIONS
--------------
	- What smoothing technique to use?
		As the sample data might not be large enough to give smooth probabilities
		some idf will be very high and with a small tf, it would cause an errorneous detection.
		E.g. to cover the minimum bigrams + offseted bigrams (256*256*MAX_OFFSET=256)
		we will have 16 777 216 cases. The probabilities for a random item 
		is  1/16 777 216, for a minimum smoothing you would need each item 10 times 
		(e.g. this is 160mb of data containing only the first 256bytes, for each filetype)
